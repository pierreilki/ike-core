This project is aimed to provide the simplest way to install kubernetes on AMD-64 bare-metal, virtual & Cloud environments.
Currently, Ubuntu 18.04 & 20.04,  Centos 7 and Debian 10  are supported, but several other operating systems will be available soon.

Official documentation is available at [Agorakube Website](https://agorakube.ilkilabs.io/)

Master branch is stable.

## What is AgoraKube

[AgoraKube](https://agorakube.ilkilabs.io/) is an easy-to-use, stable Kubernetes distribution (Kubernetes v1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, 1.19).

By its symplicity, [AgoraKube](https://agorakube.ilkilabs.io/) provide a good way to deploy and manage K8S Clusters.

[AgoraKube](https://agorakube.ilkilabs.io/) is based on Ansible scripts that install and configure Kubernetes components (control plane and data plane) quickly on bare-metal / VMs / Cloud Instances, as systemd services.

This distribution is also adaptive by offering the opportunity to customize your deployment and fit to your needs : 
* OS : Ubuntu-18.04/20.04-amd64 and Centos 7.X-amd64, Debian-10-amd64 
* DNS Service: CoreDNS
* Ingress Controller Traefik v2 & HA-Proxy & Nginx (Default)
* Container Runtime: Containerd (Default) & Docker
* Certificats: Self Signed PKI using OpenSSL
* Storage: OpenEBS
* Monitoring: Prometheus/Grafana/node-Exporter
* CNI plugin: Kube-router, Calico
* MetalLB (L2/ARP mode for external LB)
* Metrics-Server
* Kubernetes-Dashboard

This project is currently under active development so other customizable options will be added soon.

## How to install

We regularly use a machine to deploy every cluster. We only use it for deployment.

### Setup

#### On the "deployment" node
Execute this command in order to install Ansible and clone the repository :
```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilkilab/ike-core/master/setup-deploy.sh)
```
#### On the K8S nodes
Execute this command on each node to update them and install the last version of Python : 
```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilkilab/ike-core/master/setup-hosts.sh)
```

### Installation instructions

To deploy your K8S cluster follow these [instructions](docs/instructions.md).
